# Jack's Car Rental Problem from *Reinforcement Learning* by Sutton, Barto â€“ 2nd Edition (2018)
This is a dynamic programming implementation of the "Jack's Car Rental" problem (Example 4.2) in Chapter 4.3 of the book.  
It's nice and fast, and treats the original, and modified problems (Exercise 4.7).

## Modified Problem from Exercise 4.7
Here, the first car moved from the first to the second location on any given day incurs no cost. But when storing more than ten cars in a location, that location incurs an extra cost of $4 for extra parking space that night.
